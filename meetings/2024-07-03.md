Some news:

- PRs in `espanso/hub` were checked, merged, and tagged if a change is needed.
Thanks @smeech !

Some chores:

- Checked and we are OK with the permissions
- Checked the dashboard [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/espanso/projects/1)
- Talk about prorities. [Discord link to chat](https://discord.com/channels/884163483409731584/1013902954350248008/1225773043985682553).
 We decided that having 3 levels of priority is fine, we already have a tag
    called `high priority`, so we have high and normal then. We add the `low
    priority` and then we have the 3 levels.

Some questions:

- We talked about Textexpander_android[discussion link](https://github.com/espanso/espanso/discussions/1252)
 and decided to offer a place as the collaboration project

- We also talked about the license, so far [SignPath](https://about.signpath.io/product/open-source)
seems a reasonable way to signature the software. [Tracking issue](https://github.com/espanso/espanso/issues/1928)

- Regarding the releases, it would be great to remove the `Beta` from the version 2
which is far from it nowadays, and also it would be cool if we have some tool
to download the latest compiled dev version, instead of compiling every time
